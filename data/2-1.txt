To some modern societies the computer is one of the necessaries of life. The miracles it can do are gimpy unbelievable. I have always cherished to crack all the hard nuts in the world. Whenever I hear that a lot of people have died of hunger in this strife-ridden world, I cannot but hope that I have this computer in hand to find the way to provide an endless supply of food. In that case we wouldnâ€˜t worry about starvation when a war breaks out or when some disaster occurs. Personally I even wish it could help me improve my English. But the long and short of it is that ever powerful it may be, the computer, as we can safely predict, cannot cure all the ills of mankind and cannot surmount all the difficulties we constantly run into. However, we enjoy being dreamers, for in dreams we can find happiness often denied us. 2
