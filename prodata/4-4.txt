Mathematical modeling serves as a bridge between abstract theory and real-world applications. Whether simulating population dynamics, predicting financial trends, or optimizing logistical operations, mathematical models provide a systematic framework for problem-solving. The interdisciplinary nature of mathematical modeling highlights its role in addressing complex challenges across diverse domains.Number theory, the study of integers and their properties, finds practical applications in the realm of cryptography. As the backbone of secure communication systems, number theory ensures the confidentiality and integrity of digital information. The interplay between prime numbers, modular arithmetic, and cryptographic algorithms showcases the intrinsic connection between pure mathematical concepts and their technological implementations. 4
