While automobiles have undoubtedly revolutionized the way we travel, the environmental impact of mass car usage has raised concerns. The combustion of fossil fuels in traditional internal combustion engines contributes to air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. In response to these challenges, the industry is witnessing a shift towards electric vehicles (EVs) and sustainable technologies. These advancements aim to reduce the carbon footprint of automobiles and create a more eco-friendly transportation landscape. In response to environmental concerns, the automotive industry is steering towards greener alternatives. Electric vehicles (EVs), powered by lithium-ion batteries, promise zero-emission transportation. Additionally, developments in hydrogen fuel cell technology offer a glimpse into a future where sustainability is at the core of automotive design. 1
