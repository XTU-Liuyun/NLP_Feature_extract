The popularization of mathematics plays a crucial role in demystifying the subject and making it accessible to a broader audience. Through popular science books, documentaries, and educational outreach programs, mathematicians and educators strive to communicate the beauty and relevance of mathematical ideas to the general public. A mathematically literate society is better equipped to appreciate the profound impact of mathematics on various aspects of our lives.Even in the 21st century, many mathematical problems remain unsolved, inviting exploration and inquiry. The pursuit of solutions to these open problems propels mathematical research forward. From the Riemann Hypothesis to the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, these challenges not only captivate the mathematical community but also highlight the boundless nature of mathematical exploration. 4
