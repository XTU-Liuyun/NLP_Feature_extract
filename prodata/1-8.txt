The journey of automobiles dates back to the late 19th century, marked by the invention of the first practical car by Karl Benz in 1886. Since then, the automotive industry has witnessed a rapid evolution, with the introduction of mass production techniques by Henry Ford in the early 20th century, making cars more accessible to the general public. The classic designs of the past have paved the way for sleek, high-tech vehicles that showcase cutting-edge engineering and design. The automotive landscape is continually transformed by technological innovations. Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), electric powertrains, and connectivity features redefine the driving experience. From adaptive cruise control to smart infotainment systems, these advancements enhance safety, efficiency, and overall driving pleasure. 1
